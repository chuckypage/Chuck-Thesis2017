   <H1>Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists? </H1>  
   <H5>by Linda Nochlin </H2>
 <p> "Why have there been no great women artists?" The question tolls reproachfully in the background of most
discussions of the so-called woman problem. But like so many other so-called questions involved in the
feminist "controversy," it falsifies the nature of the issue at the same time that it insidiously supplies its
own answer: "There are no great women artists because women are incapable of greatness."</p>

<p>The assumptions behind such a question are varied in range and sophistication, running anywhere from
"scientifically proven" demonstrations of the inability of human beings with wombs rather than penises to
create anything significant, to relatively open minded wonderment that women, despite so many years of
near equality and after all, a lot of men have had their disadvantages too have still not achieved anything of
exceptional significance in the visual arts.</p>

<p>The feminist's first reaction is to swallow the bait, hook, line and sinker, and to attempt to answer the
question as it is put: that is, to dig up examples of worthy or insufficiently appreciated women artists
throughout history; to rehabilitate rather modest, if interesting and productive careers; to "rediscover"
forgotten flower painters or David followers and make out a case for them; to demonstrate that Berthe
Morisot was really less dependent upon Manet than one had been led to think-in other words, to engage in
the normal activity of the specialist scholar who makes a case for the importance of his very own neglected
or minor master. Such attempts, whether undertaken from a feminist point of view, like the ambitious
article on women artists which appeared in the 1858 Westminster Review, or more recent scholarly studies
on such artists as Angelica Kauffmann and Artemisia Gentileschi, are certainly worth the effort, both in
adding to our knowledge of women's achievement and of art history generally. But they do nothing to
question the assumptions lying behind the question "Why have there been no great women artists?" On the
contrary, by attempting to answer it, they tacitly reinforce its negative implications.</p>

<p>Another attempt to answer the question involves shifting the ground slightly and asserting, as some
contemporary feminists do, that there is a different kind of "greatness" for women's art than for men's,
thereby postulating the existence of a distinctive and recognizable feminine style, different both in its
formal and its expressive qualities and based on the special character of women's situation and experience.</p>

<p>This, on the surface of it, seems reasonable enough: in general, women's experience and situation in
society, and hence as artists, is different from men's, and certainly the art produced by a group of
consciously united and purposefully articulate women intent on bodying forth a group consciousness of
feminine experience might indeed be stylistically identifiable as feminist, if not feminine, art.
Unfortunately, though this remains within the realm of possibility it has so far not occurred. While the
members of the Danube School, the followers of Caravaggio, the painters gathered around Gauguin at
Pont-Aven, the Blue Rider, or the Cubists may be recognized by certain clearly defined stylistic or
expressive qualities, no such common qualities of "femininity" would seem to link the styles of women
artists generally, any more than such qualities can be said to link women writers, a case brilliantly argued,
against the most devastating, and mutually contradictory, masculine critical cliches, by Mary Ellmann in
her Thinking about Women. No subtle essence of femininity would seem to link the work of Artemesia
Gentileschi, Mine Vigee-Lebrun, Angelica Kauffmann, Rosa Bonheur, Berthe Morlsot, Suzanne Valadon,
Kathe Kollwitz, Barbara Hepworth, Georgia O'Keeffe, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Helen Frankenthaler, Bridget
Riley, Lee Bontecou, or Louise Nevelson, any more than that of Sappho, Marie de France, Jane Austen,
Emily Bronte, George Sand, George Eliot, Virginia Woolf, Gertrude Stein, Anais Nin, Emily Dickinson,
Sylvia Plath, and Susan Sontag. In every instance, women artists and writers would seem to be closer to
other artists and writers of their own period and outlook than they are to each other.</p>

<p>Women artists are more inward-looking, more delicate and nuanced in their treatment of their medium, it
may be asserted. But which of the women artists cited above is more inward-turning than Redon, more
subtle and nuanced in the handling of pigment than Corot? Is Fragonard more or less feminine than Mme.
Vigee-Lebrun? Or is it not more a question of the whole Rococo style of eighteenth-century France being
"feminine," if judged in terms of a binary scale of "masculinity" versus "femininity"? Certainly, if
daintiness, delicacy, and preciousness are to be counted as earmarks Of a feminine style, there is nothing
fragile about Rosa Bonheur's Horse Fair, nor dainty and introverted about Helen Frankenthaler's giant
canvases. If women have turned to scenes of domestic life, or of children, so did Jan Steen, Chardin, and
the Impressionists Renoir and Monet as well as Morisot and Cassatt. In any case, the mere choice of a
certain realm of subject matter, or the restriction to certain subjects, is not to be equated with a style, much
less with some sort of quintessentially feminine style.</p>

<p>The problem lies not so much with some feminists' concept of what femininity is, but rather with their
misconception-shared with the public at large-of what art is: with the naive idea that art is the direct,
personal expression of individual emotional experience, a translation of personal life into visual terms. Art
is almost never that, great art never is. The making of art involves a self-consistent language of form, more
or less dependent upon, or free from, given temporally defined conventions, schemata, or systems of
notation, which have to be learned or worked out, either through teaching, apprenticeship, or a long period
of individual experimentation. The language of art is, more materially, embodied in paint and line on
canvas or paper, in stone or clay or plastic or metal it is neither a sob story nor a confidential whisper.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that there have been no supremely great women artists, as far as we know,
although there have been many interesting and very good ones who remain insufficiently investigated or
appreciated; nor have there been any great Lithuanian jazz pianists, nor Eskimo tennis players, no matter
how much we might wish there had been. That this should be the case is regrettable, but no amount of
manipulating the historical or critical evidence will alter the situation; nor will accusations of malechauvinist
distortion of history. There are no women equivalents for Michelangelo or Rembrandt,
Delacroix or Cezanne, Picasso or Matisse, or even, in very recent times, for de Kooning or Warhol, any
more than there are black American equivalents for the same. If there actually were large numbers of
"hidden" great women artists, or if there really, should be different standards for women's art as opposed to
men's--and one can't have it both ways--then what are feminists fighting for? If women have in fact
achieved the same status as men in the arts, then the status quo is fine as it is.</p>

<p>But in actuality, as we all know, things as they are and as they have been, in the arts as in a hundred other
areas, are stultifying, oppressive, and discouraging to all those, women among them, who did not have the
good fortune to be born white, preferably middle class and, above all, male. The fault lies not in our stars,
our hormones, our menstrual cycles, or our empty internal spaces, but in our institutions and our educationeducation
understood to include everything that happens to us from the moment we enter this world of
meaningful symbols, signs, and signals. The miracle is, in fact, that given the overwhelming odds against
women, or blacks, that so many of both have managed to achieve so much sheer excellence, in those
bailiwicks of white masculine prerogative like science, politics, or the arts.</p>

<p>It is when one really starts thinking about the implications of "Why have there been no great women
artists?" that one begins to realize to what extent our consciousness of how things are in the world has been
conditioned-and often falsified-by the way the most important questions are posed. We tend to take it for
granted that there really is an East Asian Problem, a Poverty Problem, a Black Problem and a Woman
Problem. But first we must ask ourselves who is formulating these "questions," and then, what purposes
such formulations may serve. (We may, of course, refresh our memories with the connotations of the Nazis'
"Jewish Problem.") Indeed, in our time of instant communication, "problems" are rapidly formulated to
rationalize the bad conscience of those with power: thus the problem posed by Americans in Vietnam and
Cambodia is referred to by Americans as the "East Asian Problem," whereas East Asians may view it, more
realistically, as the "American Problem"; the so-called Poverty Problem might more directly be viewed as
the "Wealth Problem" by denizens of urban ghettos or rural wastelands; the same irony twists the White
Problem into its opposite, a Black Problem; and the same inverse logic turns up in the formulation of our
own present state of affairs as the "Woman Problem."</p>

<p>Now the "Woman Problem," like all human problems, so-called (and the very idea of calling anything to do
with human beings a "problem" is, of course, a fairly recent one) is not amenable to "solution" at all, since
what human problems involve is reinterpretation of the nature of the situation, or a radical alteration of
stance or program on the part of the "problems " themselves. Thus women and their situation in the arts, as
in other realms of endeavor, are not a "problem" to be viewed through the eyes of the dominant male power
elite. Instead, women must conceive of themselves as potentially, if not actually, equal subjects, and must
be willing to look the facts of their situation full in the face, without self-pity, or cop-outs; at the same time
they must view their situation with that high degree of emotional and intellectual commitment necessary to
create a world in which equal achievement will be not only made possible but actively encouraged by
social institutions.</p>

<p>It is certainly not realistic to hope that a majority of men, in the arts or in any other field, will soon see the
light and find that it is in their own self-interest to grant complete equality to women, as some feminists
optimistically assert, or to maintain that men themselves will soon realize that they are diminished by
denying themselves access to traditionally "feminine" realms and emotional reactions. After all, there are
few areas that are really "denied" to men, if the level of operations demanded be transcendent, responsible,
or rewarding enough: men who have a need for "feminine" involvement with babies or children gain status
as pediatricians or child psychologists, with a nurse (female) to do the more routine work; those who feel
the urge for kitchen creativity may gain fame as master chefs; and, of course, men who yearn to fulfill
themselves through what are often termed "feminine" artistic interests can find themselves as painters or
sculptors, rather than as volunteer museum aides or part-time ceramists, as their female counterparts so
often end up doing; as far as scholarship is concerned, how many men would be willing to change their
jobs as teachers and researchers for those of unpaid, part-time research assistants and typists as well as fulltime
nannies and domestic workers?</p>

<p>Those who have privileges inevitably hold on to them, and hold tight, no matter how marginal the
advantage involved, until compelled to bow to superior power of one sort or another.</p>

<p>Thus the question of women's equality--in art as in any other realm--devolves not upon the relative
benevolence or ill-will of individual men, nor the self-confidence or abjectness of individual women, but
rather on the very nature of our institutional structures themselves and the view of reality which they
impose on the human beings who are part of them. As John Stuart Mill pointed out more than a century
ago: "Everything which is usual appears natural. The subjection of women to men being a universal
custom, any departure from it quite naturally appears unnatural."' Most men, despite lip service to equality,
are reluctant to give up this "natural" order of things in which their advantages are so great; for women, the
case is further complicated by the fact that, as Mill astutely pointed out, unlike other oppressed groups or
castes, men demand of them not only submission but unqualified affection as well; thus women are often
weakened by the internalized demands of the male-dominated society itself, as well as by a plethora of
material goods and comforts: the middle-class woman has a great deal more to lose than her chains.</p>

<p>The question "Why have there been no great women artists?" is simply the top tenth of an iceberg of
misinterpretation and misconception; beneath lies a vast dark bulk of shaky idees recues about the nature of
art and its situational concomitants, about the nature of human abilities in general and of human excellence
in particular, and the role that the social order plays in all of this. While the "woman problem" as such may
be a pseudo-issue, the misconceptions involved in the question "Why have there been no great women
artists?" points to major areas of intellectual obfuscation beyond the specific political and ideological issues
involved in the subjection of women. Basic to the question are many naive, distorted, uncritical
assumptions about the making of art in general, as well as the making of great art. These assumptions,
conscious or unconscious, link together such unlikely superstars as Michelangelo and van Gogh, Raphael
and Jackson Pollock under the rubric of "Great"-an honorific attested to by the number of scholarly
monographs devoted to the artist in question-and the Great Artist is, of course, conceived of as one who has
"Genius"; Genius, in turn, is thought of as an atemporal and mysterious power somehow embedded in the
person of the Great Artist.' Such ideas are related to unquestioned, often unconscious, meta-historical
premises that make Hippolyte Taine's race-milieu-moment formulation of the dimensions of historical
thought seem a model of sophistication. But these assumptions are intrinsic to a great deal of art-historical
writing. It is no accident that the crucial question of the conditions generally productive of great art has so
rarely been investigated, or that attempts to investigate such general problems have, until fairly recently,
been dismissed as unscholarly, too broad, or the province of some other discipline, like sociology. To
encourage a dispassionate, impersonal, sociological, and institutionally oriented approach would reveal the
entire romantic, elitist, individual-glorifying, and monograph-producing substructure upon which the
profession of art history is based, and which has only recently been called into question by a group of
younger dissidents.</p>

<p>Underlying the question about woman as artist, then, we find the myth of the Great Artist-subject of a
hundred monographs, unique, godlike-bearing within his person since birth a mysterious essence, rather
like the golden nugget in Mrs. Grass's chicken soup, called Genius or Talent, which, like murder, must
always out, no matter how unlikely or unpromising the circumstances.</p>

<p>The magical aura surrounding the representational arts and their creators has, of course, given birth to
myths since the earliest times. Interestingly enough, the same magical abilities attributed by Pliny to the
Greek sculptor Lysippos in antiquity--the mysterious inner call in early youth, the lack of any teacher but
Nature herself--is repeated as late as the nineteenth century by Max Buchon in his biography of Courbet.
The supernatural powers of the artist as imitator, his control of strong, possibly dangerous powers, have
functioned historically to set him off from others as a godlike creator, one who creates Being out of
nothing. The fairy tale of the discovery by an older artist or discerning patron of the Boy Wonder, usually
in the guise of a lowly shepherd boy, has been a stock-in-trade of artistic mythology ever since Vasari
immortalized the young Giotto, discovered by the great Cimabue while the lad was guarding his flocks,
drawing sheep on a stone; Cimabue, overcome with admiration for the realism of the drawing, immediately
invited the humble youth to be his pupil. Through some mysterious coincidence, later artists including
Beccafumi, Andrea Sansovino, Andrea del Castagno, Mantegna, Zurbardn, and Goya were all discovered
in similar pastoral circumstances. Even when the young Great Artist was not fortunate enough to come
equipped with a flock of sheep, his talent always seems to have manifested itself very early, and
independent of any external encouragement: Filippo Lippi and Poussin, Courbet and Monet are all reported
to have drawn caricatures in the margins of their schoolbooks instead of studying the required subjects-we
never, of course, hear about the youths who neglected their studies and scribbled in the margins of their
notebooks without ever becoming anything more elevated than department-store clerks or shoe salesmen.
The great Michelangelo himself, according to his biographer and pupil, Vasari, did more drawing than
studying as a child. So pronounced was his talent, reports Vasari, that when his master, Ghirlandalo,
absented himself momentarily from his work in Santa Maria Novella, and the young art student took the
opportunity to draw "the scaffolding, trestles, pots of paint, brushes and the apprentices at their tasks" in
this brief absence, he did it so skillfully that upon his return the master exclaimed: "This boy knows more
than I do."</p>

<p>As is so often the case, such stories, which probably have some truth in them, tend both to reflect and
perpetuate the attitudes they subsume. Even when based on fact, these myths about the early manifestations
of genius are misleading. It is no doubt true, for example, that the young Picasso passed all the
examinations for entrance to the Barcelona, and later to the Madrid, Academy of Art at the age of fifteen in
but a single day, a feat of such difficulty that most candidates required a month of preparation. But one
would like to find out more about similar precocious qualifiers for art academies who then went on to
achieve nothing but mediocrity or failure--in whom, of course, art historians are uninterested--or to study in
greater detail the role played by Picasso's art-professor father in the pictorial precocity of his son. What if
Picasso had been born a girl? Would Senor Ruiz have paid as much attention or stimulated as much
ambition for achievement in a little Pablita?</p>

<p>What is stressed in all these stories is the apparently miraculous, nondetermined, and asocial nature of
artistic achievement; this semireligious conception of the artist's role is elevated to hagiography in the
nineteenth century, when art historians, critics, and, not least, some of the artists themselves tended to
elevate the making of art into a substitute religion, the last bulwark of higher values in a materialistic
world. The artist, in the nineteenth-century Saints' Legend, struggles against the most determined parental
and social opposition, suffering the slings and arrows of social opprobrium like any Christian martyr, and
ultimately succeeds against all odds generally, alas, after his death-because from deep within himself
radiates that mysterious, holy effulgence: Genius. Here we have the mad van Gogh, spinning out
sunflowers despite epileptic seizures and near-starvation; Cezanne, braving paternal rejection and public
scorn in order to revolutionize painting; Gauguin throwing away respectability and financial security with a
single existential gesture to pursue his calling in the tropics; or Toulouse-Lautrec, dwarfed, crippled, and
alcoholic, sacrificing his aristocratic birthright in favor of the squalid surroundings that provided him with
inspiration.</p>

<p>Now no serious contemporary art historian takes such obvious fairy tales at their face value. Yet it is this
sort of mythology about artistic achievement and its concomitants which forms the unconscious or
unquestioned assumptions of scholars, no matter how many crumbs are thrown to social influences, ideas
of the times, economic crises, and so on. Behind the most sophisticated investigations of great artists-more
specifically, the art-historical monograph, which accepts the notion of the great artist as primary, and the
social and institutional structures within which he lived and worked as mere secondary "influences" or
"background"-lurks the golden-nugget theory of genius and the free-enterprise conception of individual
achievement. On this basis, women's lack of major achievement in art may be formulated as a syllogism: If
women had the golden nugget of artistic genius then it would reveal itself. But it has never revealed itself.
O.E.D. Women do not have the golden nugget theory of artistic genius. If Giotto, the obscure shepherd boy,
and van Gogh with his fits could make it, why not women?</p>

<p>Yet as soon as one leaves behind the world of fairy tale and self-fulfilling prophecy and, instead, casts a
dispassionate eye on the actual situations in which important art production has existed, in the total range of
its social and institutional structures throughout history, one finds that t he very questions which are fruitful
or relevant for the historian to ask shape up rather differently. One would like to ask, for instance, from
what social classes artists were most likely to come at different periods of art history, from what castes and
subgroup. What proportion of painters and sculptors, or more specifically, of major painters and sculptors,
came from families in which their fathers or other close relatives were painters and sculptors or engaged in
related professions? As Nikolaus Pevsner points out in his discussion of the French Academy in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the transmission of the artistic profession from father to son was
considered a matter of course (as it was with the Coypels, the Coustous, the Van Loos, etc.); indeed, sons
of academicians were exempted from the customary fees for lessons. Despite the noteworthy and
dramatically satisfying cases of the great father-rejecting revoltes~s of the nineteenth century, one might be
forced to admit that a large proportion of artists, great and not-so-great, in the days when it was normal for
sons to follow in their fathers' footsteps, had artist fathers. In the rank of major artists, the names of Holbein
and Durer, Raphael and Bernim, immediately spring to mind; even in our own times, one can cite the
names of Picasso, Calder, Giacometti, and Wyeth as members of artist-families.</p>

<p>As far as the relationship of artistic occupation and social class is concerned, an interesting paradigm for
the question "Why have there been no great women artists?" might well be provided by trying to answer the
question "Why have there been no great artists from the aristocracy?" One can scarcely think, before the
anti traditional nineteenth century at least, of any artist who sprang from the ranks of any more elevated
class than the upper bourgeoisie; even in the nineteenth century, Degas came from the lower nobility more
like the haute bourgeoisie, in fact-and only Toulouse-Lautrec, metamorphosed into the ranks of the
marginal by accidental deformity, could be said to have come from the loftier reaches of the upper classes.
While the aristocracy has always provided the lion's share of the patronage and the audience for art-as,
indeed, the aristocracy of wealth does even in our more democratic days-it has contributed little beyond
amateurish efforts to the creation of art itself, despite the fact that aristocrats (like many women) have had
more than their share of educational advantages, plenty of leisure and, indeed, like women, were often
encouraged to dabble in the arts and even develop into respectable amateurs, like Napoleon III's cousin, the
Princess Mathilde, who exhibited at the official Salons, or Queen Victoria, who, with Prince Albert, studied
art with no less a figure than Landseer himself. Could it be that the little golden nugget-genius-is missing
from the aristocratic makeup in the same way that it is from the feminine psyche? Or rather, is it not that
the kinds of demands and expectations placed before both aristocrats and women-the amount of time
necessarily devoted to social functions, the very kinds of activities demanded-simply made total devotion to
professional art production out of the question, indeed unthinkable, both for upper-class males and for
women generally, rather than its being a question of genius and talent?</p>

<p>When the right questions are asked about the conditions for producing art, of which the production of great
art is a subtopic, there will no doubt have to be some discussion of the situational concomitants of
intelligence and talent generally, not merely of artistic genius. Piaget and others have stressed in their
genetic epistemology that in the development of reason and in the unfolding of imagination in young
children, intelligence or, by implication, what we choose to call genius-is a dynamic activity rather than a
static essence, and an activity of a subject in a situation. As further investigations in the field of child
development imply, these abilities, or this intelligence, are built up minutely, step by step, from infancy
onward, and the patterns of adaptation-accommodation may be established so early within the subject-inan-environment
that they may indeed appear to be innate to the unsophisticated observer. Such
investigations imply that, even aside from meta-historical reasons, scholars will have to abandon the notion,
consciously articulated or not, of individual genius as innate, and as primary to the creation of art.'</p>

<p>The question "Why have there been no great women artists?" has led us to the conclusion, so far, that art is
not a free, autonomous activity of a super-endowed individual, "Influenced" by previous artists, and, more
vaguely and superficially, by "social forces," but rather, that the total situation of art making, both in terms
of the development of the art maker and in the nature and quality of the work of art itself, occur in a social
situation, are integral elements of this social structure, and are mediated and determined by specific and
definable social institutions, be they art academies, systems of patronage, mythologies of the divine creator,
artist as he-man or social outcast.</p>

may be asserted. But which of the women artists cited above is more inward-turning than Redon, more
subtle and nuanced in the handling of pigment than Corot? Is Fragonard more or less feminine than Mme.
Vigee-Lebrun? Or is it not more a question of the whole Rococo style of eighteenth-century France being
"feminine," if judged in terms of a binary scale of "masculinity" versus "femininity"? Certainly, if
daintiness, delicacy, and preciousness are to be counted as earmarks Of a feminine style, there is nothing
fragile about Rosa Bonheur's Horse Fair, nor dainty and introverted about Helen Frankenthaler's giant
canvases. If women have turned to scenes of domestic life, or of children, so did Jan Steen, Chardin, and
the Impressionists Renoir and Monet as well as Morisot and Cassatt. In any case, the mere choice of a
certain realm of subject matter, or the restriction to certain subjects, is not to be equated with a style, much
less with some sort of quintessentially feminine style.
The problem lies not so much with some feminists' concept of what femininity is, but rather with their
misconception-shared with the public at large-of what art is: with the naive idea that art is the direct,
personal expression of individual emotional experience, a translation of personal life into visual terms. Art
is almost never that, great art never is. The making of art involves a self-consistent language of form, more
or less dependent upon, or free from, given temporally defined conventions, schemata, or systems of
notation, which have to be learned or worked out, either through teaching, apprenticeship, or a long period
of individual experimentation. The language of art is, more materially, embodied in paint and line on
canvas or paper, in stone or clay or plastic or metal it is neither a sob story nor a confidential whisper.
The fact of the matter is that there have been no supremely great women artists, as far as we know,
although there have been many interesting and very good ones who remain insufficiently investigated or
appreciated; nor have there been any great Lithuanian jazz pianists, nor Eskimo tennis players, no matter
how much we might wish there had been. That this should be the case is regrettable, but no amount of
manipulating the historical or critical evidence will alter the situation; nor will accusations of malechauvinist
distortion of history. There are no women equivalents for Michelangelo or Rembrandt,
Delacroix or Cezanne, Picasso or Matisse, or even, in very recent times, for de Kooning or Warhol, any
more than there are black American equivalents for the same. If there actually were large numbers of
"hidden" great women artists, or if there really, should be different standards for women's art as opposed to
men's--and one can't have it both ways--then what are feminists fighting for? If women have in fact
achieved the same status as men in the arts, then the status quo is fine as it is.
But in actuality, as we all know, things as they are and as they have been, in the arts as in a hundred other
areas, are stultifying, oppressive, and discouraging to all those, women among them, who did not have the
good fortune to be born white, preferably middle class and, above all, male. The fault lies not in our stars,
our hormones, our menstrual cycles, or our empty internal spaces, but in our institutions and our educationeducation
understood to include everything that happens to us from the moment we enter this world of
meaningful symbols, signs, and signals. The miracle is, in fact, that given the overwhelming odds against
women, or blacks, that so many of both have managed to achieve so much sheer excellence, in those
bailiwicks of white masculine prerogative like science, politics, or the arts.
It is when one really starts thinking about the implications of "Why have there been no great women
artists?" that one begins to realize to what extent our consciousness of how things are in the world has been
conditioned-and often falsified-by the way the most important questions are posed. We tend to take it for
granted that there really is an East Asian Problem, a Poverty Problem, a Black Problem and a Woman
Problem. But first we must ask ourselves who is formulating these "questions," and then, what purposes
such formulations may serve. (We may, of course, refresh our memories with the connotations of the Nazis'
"Jewish Problem.") Indeed, in our time of instant communication, "problems" are rapidly formulated to
rationalize the bad conscience of those with power: thus the problem posed by Americans in Vietnam and
Cambodia is referred to by Americans as the "East Asian Problem," whereas East Asians may view it, more
realistically, as the "American Problem"; the so-called Poverty Problem might more directly be viewed as
the "Wealth Problem" by denizens of urban ghettos or rural wastelands; the same irony twists the White
Problem into its opposite, a Black Problem; and the same inverse logic turns up in the formulation of our
own present state of affairs as the "Woman Problem."
Now the "Woman Problem," like all human problems, so-called (and the very idea of calling anything to do
with human beings a "problem" is, of course, a fairly recent one) is not amenable to "solution" at all, since
what human problems involve is reinterpretation of the nature of the situation, or a radical alteration of
stance or program on the part of the "problems " themselves. Thus women and their situation in the arts, as
in other realms of endeavor, are not a "problem" to be viewed through the eyes of the dominant male power
elite. Instead, women must conceive of themselves as potentially, if not actually, equal subjects, and must
be willing to look the facts of their situation full in the face, without self-pity, or cop-outs; at the same time
they must view their situation with that high degree of emotional and intellectual commitment necessary to
create a world in which equal achievement will be not only made possible but actively encouraged by
social institutions.
It is certainly not realistic to hope that a majority of men, in the arts or in any other field, will soon see the
light and find that it is in their own self-interest to grant complete equality to women, as some feminists
optimistically assert, or to maintain that men themselves will soon realize that they are diminished by
denying themselves access to traditionally "feminine" realms and emotional reactions. After all, there are
few areas that are really "denied" to men, if the level of operations demanded be transcendent, responsible,
or rewarding enough: men who have a need for "feminine" involvement with babies or children gain status
as pediatricians or child psychologists, with a nurse (female) to do the more routine work; those who feel
the urge for kitchen creativity may gain fame as master chefs; and, of course, men who yearn to fulfill
themselves through what are often termed "feminine" artistic interests can find themselves as painters or
sculptors, rather than as volunteer museum aides or part-time ceramists, as their female counterparts so
often end up doing; as far as scholarship is concerned, how many men would be willing to change their
jobs as teachers and researchers for those of unpaid, part-time research assistants and typists as well as fulltime
nannies and domestic workers?
Those who have privileges inevitably hold on to them, and hold tight, no matter how marginal the
advantage involved, until compelled to bow to superior power of one sort or another.
Thus the question of women's equality--in art as in any other realm--devolves not upon the relative
benevolence or ill-will of individual men, nor the self-confidence or abjectness of individual women, but
rather on the very nature of our institutional structures themselves and the view of reality which they
impose on the human beings who are part of them. As John Stuart Mill pointed out more than a century
ago: "Everything which is usual appears natural. The subjection of women to men being a universal
custom, any departure from it quite naturally appears unnatural."' Most men, despite lip service to equality,
are reluctant to give up this "natural" order of things in which their advantages are so great; for women, the
case is further complicated by the fact that, as Mill astutely pointed out, unlike other oppressed groups or
castes, men demand of them not only submission but unqualified affection as well; thus women are often
weakened by the internalized demands of the male-dominated society itself, as well as by a plethora of
material goods and comforts: the middle-class woman has a great deal more to lose than her chains.
The question "Why have there been no great women artists?" is simply the top tenth of an iceberg of
misinterpretation and misconception; beneath lies a vast dark bulk of shaky idees recues about the nature of
art and its situational concomitants, about the nature of human abilities in general and of human excellence
in particular, and the role that the social order plays in all of this. While the "woman problem" as such may
be a pseudo-issue, the misconceptions involved in the question "Why have there been no great women
artists?" points to major areas of intellectual obfuscation beyond the specific political and ideological issues
involved in the subjection of women. Basic to the question are many naive, distorted, uncritical
assumptions about the making of art in general, as well as the making of great art. These assumptions,
conscious or unconscious, link together such unlikely superstars as Michelangelo and van Gogh, Raphael
and Jackson Pollock under the rubric of "Great"-an honorific attested to by the number of scholarly
monographs devoted to the artist in question-and the Great Artist is, of course, conceived of as one who has
"Genius"; Genius, in turn, is thought of as an atemporal and mysterious power somehow embedded in the
person of the Great Artist.' Such ideas are related to unquestioned, often unconscious, meta-historical
premises that make Hippolyte Taine's race-milieu-moment formulation of the dimensions of historical
thought seem a model of sophistication. But these assumptions are intrinsic to a great deal of art-historical
writing. It is no accident that the crucial question of the conditions generally productive of great art has so
rarely been investigated, or that attempts to investigate such general problems have, until fairly recently,
been dismissed as unscholarly, too broad, or the province of some other discipline, like sociology. To
encourage a dispassionate, impersonal, sociological, and institutionally oriented approach would reveal the
entire romantic, elitist, individual-glorifying, and monograph-producing substructure upon which the
profession of art history is based, and which has only recently been called into question by a group of
younger dissidents.
Underlying the question about woman as artist, then, we find the myth of the Great Artist-subject of a
hundred monographs, unique, godlike-bearing within his person since birth a mysterious essence, rather
like the golden nugget in Mrs. Grass's chicken soup, called Genius or Talent, which, like murder, must
always out, no matter how unlikely or unpromising the circumstances.
The magical aura surrounding the representational arts and their creators has, of course, given birth to
myths since the earliest times. Interestingly enough, the same magical abilities attributed by Pliny to the
Greek sculptor Lysippos in antiquity--the mysterious inner call in early youth, the lack of any teacher but
Nature herself--is repeated as late as the nineteenth century by Max Buchon in his biography of Courbet.
The supernatural powers of the artist as imitator, his control of strong, possibly dangerous powers, have
functioned historically to set him off from others as a godlike creator, one who creates Being out of
nothing. The fairy tale of the discovery by an older artist or discerning patron of the Boy Wonder, usually
in the guise of a lowly shepherd boy, has been a stock-in-trade of artistic mythology ever since Vasari
immortalized the young Giotto, discovered by the great Cimabue while the lad was guarding his flocks,
drawing sheep on a stone; Cimabue, overcome with admiration for the realism of the drawing, immediately
invited the humble youth to be his pupil. Through some mysterious coincidence, later artists including
Beccafumi, Andrea Sansovino, Andrea del Castagno, Mantegna, Zurbardn, and Goya were all discovered
in similar pastoral circumstances. Even when the young Great Artist was not fortunate enough to come
equipped with a flock of sheep, his talent always seems to have manifested itself very early, and
independent of any external encouragement: Filippo Lippi and Poussin, Courbet and Monet are all reported
to have drawn caricatures in the margins of their schoolbooks instead of studying the required subjects-we
never, of course, hear about the youths who neglected their studies and scribbled in the margins of their
notebooks without ever becoming anything more elevated than department-store clerks or shoe salesmen.
The great Michelangelo himself, according to his biographer and pupil, Vasari, did more drawing than
studying as a child. So pronounced was his talent, reports Vasari, that when his master, Ghirlandalo,
absented himself momentarily from his work in Santa Maria Novella, and the young art student took the
opportunity to draw "the scaffolding, trestles, pots of paint, brushes and the apprentices at their tasks" in
this brief absence, he did it so skillfully that upon his return the master exclaimed: "This boy knows more
than I do."
As is so often the case, such stories, which probably have some truth in them, tend both to reflect and
perpetuate the attitudes they subsume. Even when based on fact, these myths about the early manifestations
of genius are misleading. It is no doubt true, for example, that the young Picasso passed all the
examinations for entrance to the Barcelona, and later to the Madrid, Academy of Art at the age of fifteen in
but a single day, a feat of such difficulty that most candidates required a month of preparation. But one
would like to find out more about similar precocious qualifiers for art academies who then went on to
achieve nothing but mediocrity or failure--in whom, of course, art historians are uninterested--or to study in
greater detail the role played by Picasso's art-professor father in the pictorial precocity of his son. What if
Picasso had been born a girl? Would Senor Ruiz have paid as much attention or stimulated as much
ambition for achievement in a little Pablita?
What is stressed in all these stories is the apparently miraculous, nondetermined, and asocial nature of
artistic achievement; this semireligious conception of the artist's role is elevated to hagiography in the
nineteenth century, when art historians, critics, and, not least, some of the artists themselves tended to
elevate the making of art into a substitute religion, the last bulwark of higher values in a materialistic
world. The artist, in the nineteenth-century Saints' Legend, struggles against the most determined parental
and social opposition, suffering the slings and arrows of social opprobrium like any Christian martyr, and
ultimately succeeds against all odds generally, alas, after his death-because from deep within himself
radiates that mysterious, holy effulgence: Genius. Here we have the mad van Gogh, spinning out
sunflowers despite epileptic seizures and near-starvation; Cezanne, braving paternal rejection and public
scorn in order to revolutionize painting; Gauguin throwing away respectability and financial security with a
single existential gesture to pursue his calling in the tropics; or Toulouse-Lautrec, dwarfed, crippled, and
alcoholic, sacrificing his aristocratic birthright in favor of the squalid surroundings that provided him with
inspiration.
Now no serious contemporary art historian takes such obvious fairy tales at their face value. Yet it is this
sort of mythology about artistic achievement and its concomitants which forms the unconscious or
unquestioned assumptions of scholars, no matter how many crumbs are thrown to social influences, ideas
of the times, economic crises, and so on. Behind the most sophisticated investigations of great artists-more
specifically, the art-historical monograph, which accepts the notion of the great artist as primary, and the
social and institutional structures within which he lived and worked as mere secondary "influences" or
"background"-lurks the golden-nugget theory of genius and the free-enterprise conception of individual
achievement. On this basis, women's lack of major achievement in art may be formulated as a syllogism: If
women had the golden nugget of artistic genius then it would reveal itself. But it has never revealed itself.
O.E.D. Women do not have the golden nugget theory of artistic genius. If Giotto, the obscure shepherd boy,
and van Gogh with his fits could make it, why not women?
Yet as soon as one leaves behind the world of fairy tale and self-fulfilling prophecy and, instead, casts a
dispassionate eye on the actual situations in which important art production has existed, in the total range of
its social and institutional structures throughout history, one finds that t he very questions which are fruitful
or relevant for the historian to ask shape up rather differently. One would like to ask, for instance, from
what social classes artists were most likely to come at different periods of art history, from what castes and
subgroup. What proportion of painters and sculptors, or more specifically, of major painters and sculptors,
came from families in which their fathers or other close relatives were painters and sculptors or engaged in
related professions? As Nikolaus Pevsner points out in his discussion of the French Academy in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the transmission of the artistic profession from father to son was
considered a matter of course (as it was with the Coypels, the Coustous, the Van Loos, etc.); indeed, sons
of academicians were exempted from the customary fees for lessons. Despite the noteworthy and
dramatically satisfying cases of the great father-rejecting revoltes~s of the nineteenth century, one might be
forced to admit that a large proportion of artists, great and not-so-great, in the days when it was normal for
sons to follow in their fathers' footsteps, had artist fathers. In the rank of major artists, the names of Holbein
and Durer, Raphael and Bernim, immediately spring to mind; even in our own times, one can cite the
names of Picasso, Calder, Giacometti, and Wyeth as members of artist-families.
As far as the relationship of artistic occupation and social class is concerned, an interesting paradigm for
the question "Why have there been no great women artists?" might well be provided by trying to answer the
question "Why have there been no great artists from the aristocracy?" One can scarcely think, before the
anti traditional nineteenth century at least, of any artist who sprang from the ranks of any more elevated
class than the upper bourgeoisie; even in the nineteenth century, Degas came from the lower nobility more
like the haute bourgeoisie, in fact-and only Toulouse-Lautrec, metamorphosed into the ranks of the
marginal by accidental deformity, could be said to have come from the loftier reaches of the upper classes.
While the aristocracy has always provided the lion's share of the patronage and the audience for art-as,
indeed, the aristocracy of wealth does even in our more democratic days-it has contributed little beyond
amateurish efforts to the creation of art itself, despite the fact that aristocrats (like many women) have had
more than their share of educational advantages, plenty of leisure and, indeed, like women, were often
encouraged to dabble in the arts and even develop into respectable amateurs, like Napoleon III's cousin, the
Princess Mathilde, who exhibited at the official Salons, or Queen Victoria, who, with Prince Albert, studied
art with no less a figure than Landseer himself. Could it be that the little golden nugget-genius-is missing
from the aristocratic makeup in the same way that it is from the feminine psyche? Or rather, is it not that
the kinds of demands and expectations placed before both aristocrats and women-the amount of time
necessarily devoted to social functions, the very kinds of activities demanded-simply made total devotion to
professional art production out of the question, indeed unthinkable, both for upper-class males and for
women generally, rather than its being a question of genius and talent?
When the right questions are asked about the conditions for producing art, of which the production of great
art is a subtopic, there will no doubt have to be some discussion of the situational concomitants of
intelligence and talent generally, not merely of artistic genius. Piaget and others have stressed in their
genetic epistemology that in the development of reason and in the unfolding of imagination in young
children, intelligence or, by implication, what we choose to call genius-is a dynamic activity rather than a
static essence, and an activity of a subject in a situation. As further investigations in the field of child
development imply, these abilities, or this intelligence, are built up minutely, step by step, from infancy
onward, and the patterns of adaptation-accommodation may be established so early within the subject-inan-environment
that they may indeed appear to be innate to the unsophisticated observer. Such
investigations imply that, even aside from meta-historical reasons, scholars will have to abandon the notion,
consciously articulated or not, of individual genius as innate, and as primary to the creation of art.'
The question "Why have there been no great women artists?" has led us to the conclusion, so far, that art is
not a free, autonomous activity of a super-endowed individual, "Influenced" by previous artists, and, more
vaguely and superficially, by "social forces," but rather, that the total situation of art making, both in terms
of the development of the art maker and in the nature and quality of the work of art itself, occur in a social
situation, are integral elements of this social structure, and are mediated and determined by specific and
definable social institutions, be they art academies, systems of patronage, mythologies of the divine creator,
artist as he-man or social outcast.
